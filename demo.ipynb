    "# Let's make some astronomy images!\n",

    "## What do telescopes give us?\n",
    "\n",
    "A single telescope does not observe at every wavelength; different techniques, materials, and locations are often required to capture different wavelengths of light. Typically, a telescope is optimized to capture light within a relatively narrow range of wavelengths; filters are then used to separate out specific wavelengths in that range. For example, the Hubble telescope is optimized to capture visible light as well as some ultraviolet and infrared, while the Chandra X-ray Observatory is optimized for x-rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each filter, a telescope will produce (after some processing) a single grey scale \"image\" where higher values indicate that more light was received through the filter. For example, below are the grey scale images of the Whirlpool Galaxy that were returned by the Hubble telescope for its red, green, and blue optical filters.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Adding Color\n",
    "\n",
    "While these greyscale images can be very useful to astronomers for comparing observations at different wavelengths side by side, we can get a better understanding of the overall object by combining these observations. One way to do this is by assigning a different color to the data from each filter. In the case of the Hubble data above, the color choice is relatively easy since the filters correspond to the wavelengths of the colors red, green, and blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src='demo_images/whirlpool_galaxy_r.png' width=\"400\"></td><td><img src='demo_images/whirlpool_galaxy_g.png' width=\"400\"></td><td><img src='demo_images/whirlpool_galaxy_b.png' width=\"400\"></td></tr></table>\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src='demo_images/whirlpool_galaxy.png' width=\"400\"></td></tr></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital color images are actually a combination of \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" images because this is usually how they are displayed by screens and printed. When the colors are viewed on top of one another (either as light from a screen or ink on paper), they blend to give us the full rainbow of colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## False Color\n",
    "\n",
    "The filters in the image above were in visible wavelengths that have corresponding colors that could be used to color the greyscale images. But this is not always the case.! For example, all of the filters for the Chandra X-ray Observatory are in the x-ray, which is not visible to humans. Instead, astronomers will pick visible colors as a substitute to those wavelengths that are outside our visual range. In the example below, x-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (shown in magenta) is added to the Whirlpool Galaxy image from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><tr><td><img src='demo_images/whirlpool_galaxy_x.png' width=\"400\"></td></tr></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Images where astronomers use human-visible colors to represent data from filters that do not capture human-visible light are called \"false color images\". It's not that the images aren't real, they just aren't what a human would see with their naked eye if they could travel to the nebula/galaxy/planet in person.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do different wavelengths tell us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different wavelengths of light provide different information. As shown below, light at longer wavelengths (e.g. radio & infrared) is better for observing cooler things like cold gas, dust, and cooler stars. Light at shorter wavelengths (e.g. x-ray & gamma ray) is better for observing hot things like hot gas and stars.\n",

    "\n",
    "The tool below will allow you to create images of different astrophysical objects by overlaying telescope data collected at different wavelengths. The data are provided to the public on the website for the Chandra X-ray Observatory ([here](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/openFITS/multiwavelength_data.html)). On the left is a dropdown menu for selecting an object, a box for setting the size of the image produced, a checkbox for specifying whether the image displayed should be full resolution or downsampled, and expandable panels for each data layer (one for each filter available for the selected object). Each layer panel allows you to specify the color, opacity, and scaling of that layer in the image, which is displayed on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects with an * in front of them have to be downloaded first, which can take a minute or two. If you would like to browse these objects before downloading them, they can be found [here](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/openFITS/multiwavelength_data.html).\n",
    "* When the ‘Display full resolution (slow)’ box is checked, changes to the layer options will take a much longer time to show up. We recommend exploring the options without it checked and only checking it when you want to save an image.\n",
    "* To hide a layer completely, set the opacity to 0.\n",
    "* Pick three layers to be red, blue, and green as these colors can be merged into a single RGB image and are displayed independently in the image (without overlap) because that is how screens display images. Layers that are colors other than red, blue, or green will be overlayed on top of the RGB image. Sometimes the non-RGB layer can mask lower layers if its opacity is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Opacity:** How transparent the layer is. Smaller values (0) mean the layer is completely transparent, Larger values (1) mean the layer is not transparent.\n",
    "* **Logarithmic Scaling:** Maps the intensity of the color used to represent the layer to the logarithm of the data. This is useful for studying data that has a large range when you would like to see small and large changes at the same time. (Note: Enabling the logarithm option may cause an error message to pop up. Don't worry, nothing is broken---you can disgregard the message. If you're interested in why that error happens, you can ask one of the astronomers here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Images\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to save an image, click the ‘Display full resolution (slow)’ check box and wait for the image to display. Then you can right-click on the image (two finger click on Mac) and save the image to your computer. If you want to keep working, uncheck the ‘Display full resolution (slow)’ check box so that images display more quickly."
